# Wordle Finder

Automatically try to find words on [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/).

## Use

Two buttons labelled "Cheat (Progressive)" and "Cheat (Instant)" will appear above the keyboard.
The progressive cheat will guess the word based on Wordle's hints,
and the instant one will guess the word right immediately.

## How it works

The script starts by guessing a random word from the Wordle dictionary.
It then uses the feedback provided to try and find another word that could fit.
Eventually, it should be able to find the right word.
