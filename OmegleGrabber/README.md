Currently won't work with any mode on a site that lets you talk to more than one person at a time.

## Use

Once the script is installed, the current user's IP will be displayed
under the video box. When not connected, the IP of the last user will be displayed.

<!--
I've seen a lot of examples of accurancy down to the city (at least on Omegle),
so now I'm not sure if this notice is actually even true.
Commenting it out for now.

<!-- Note that the IP display **is not the actual user's**, but is the server that their connection
is relayed through to get to you.
This might be enough to get the user's country and maybe the state/province or even the city
(generally only this accurate in the US), but nothing more. -->
