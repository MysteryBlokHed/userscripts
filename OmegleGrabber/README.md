# Omegle Grabber

Get IP addresses on multiple video chat sites.

## Supported Sites

- [Omegle](https://www.omegle.com/)
- [OmeTV](https://ome.tv/)
- [ChatHub](https://chathub.cam/)

## Use

Once the script is installed, the current user's relay IP will be displayed
under the video box. When not connected, the IP of the last user will be displayed.

Note that the IP display **is not the actual user's**, but is the server that their connection
is relayed through to get to you.
This might be enough to get the user's country and maybe the state/province or even the city
(generally only this accurate in the US), but nothing more.
