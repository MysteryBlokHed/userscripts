# OmeTV Grabber

Get the relay IP addresses of users on OmeTV.

## Use

Once the script is installed, the current user's relay IP will be displayed
under the video box. When not connected, the IP of the last user will be displayed.

Note that the IP display **is not the actual user's**, but is the server that their connection
is relayed through to get to you.
This might be enough to get the user's country and maybe the city, but nothing more.
